**Small assignment 5 - prepare a news from the DLT world, discuss it, ask questions and colleagues**
1. Mini assignment for the next exercise, which we will have more of a seminar style and discussion.
2. You have to prepare some news from the cryptoworld or DLT world that you are interested in or like.
3. The novelty can be technological but also economic. 
4. Then you have up to 1 minute to tell the rest of us this news, present it and the discussion will start. 
5. When there are good questions and also good answers from your side, then you have the opportunity to get more points, the maximum total is 3 points for the exercise.
6. We recommend to prepare something for backup in case someone else has already told your news.

   - max. 1pt you can get for preparing some news that has not been presented by your classmates yet, another max. 1pt you can get for leading the discussion and answering questions (this is related to the fact that you have to look at the news a bit, it is not enough to just recite it), another max. 1pt you can get for asking questions
