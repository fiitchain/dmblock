**Small assignment bonus**
1. Make any blockchain meme. You can do more than one, but you will only get points if more than one of us laughs at one of them. But with more memes, you increase your chance ;)
2. You can use any meme generator or graphic tool, sketchbook, Word, anything.
3. You submit the final creation into AIS, in whatever format you can open on a Unix-like system.

   - If we laugh at it all 3, 3 points, if only 2, 2 points, if we at least smile at it, 1 point. Otherwise, 0.

**Scoring**
